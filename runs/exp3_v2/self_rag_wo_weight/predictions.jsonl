I need to make sure that's the most direct answer. The answer should be concise, so combining those locations.

Document 25007779_1 mentions wide tissue distribution, so that's a broader location. The question is asking for where it's located, so the answer should include both the CNS and retinae. The confidence level: the first document specifically states CNS and retinae, which are detailed locations. The other documents mention distribution but not as specific.

Looking at [19823040:19823040_1], it says that transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined. That's a direct statement supporting their connection. Then, [23074139:23074139_2] mentions that splicing is necessary for chromatin signatures, which further supports the functional interconnections. Next, [22955974:22955974_3] states that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. This indicates a temporal connection. The fourth evidence, [16921380:16921380_0], talks about a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factors", "base_prob": 0.5, "critic": {"rel_label": "Irrel", "rel_prob": 0.5, "sup_label": "Partial", "sup_prob": 0.5, "use_score": 3, "use_prob": 0.6, "notes": ""}, "score": 0.5, "safe": false, "has_citation": 1}, {"answer": "<think> Okay, I need to answer whether transcription and splicing are connected based on the given evidence. Let me look through each of the references provided. First, reference 19823040:19823040_1 mentions that transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined. It also talks about modified nucleosomes and H3K36me3 being enriched in certain regions, which suggests a connection between the two processes. That's a direct statement about their functional relationship. Then, reference 23074139:23074139_2 says that splicing is necessary for proper chromatin signatures, further supporting the idea that there's a mechanistic link between transcription, splicing, and chromatin structure. So this reinforces the connection. Reference 22955974:22955974_3 states that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. This directly links the timing of splicing to the transcription process, indicating they happen simultaneously or in sequence.

So that's another link. Document 22955974:22955974_3 states that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. That directly connects the timing of these processes.

Another point says splicing is necessary for chromatin signatures, supporting the connection between splicing, transcription, and chromatin structure. Then, it states that splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. That seems like a direct link. Also, there's an example where stalling Pol II leads to increased splicing factors and splicing, showing a kinetic link. Plus, the rate of transcription elongation is linked to alternative splicing. So all these points suggest that transcription and splicing are indeed connected. The answer should mention that they are functionally intertwined, with evidence from multiple sources.

The title says \"Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands.\" That seems directly related. The second document [25432979:25432979_0] refers to MR CLEAN as a trial comparing endovascular treatment with medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). So this also points to AIS. The third document [25517348:25517348_0] talks about patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial occlusion. Again, this is about acute ischemic stroke. The fourth", "base_prob": 0.5, "critic": {"rel_label": "Irrel", "rel_prob": 0.5, "sup_label": "Partial", "sup_prob": 0.5, "use_score": 3, "use_prob": 0.6, "notes": ""}, "score": 0.5, "safe": false, "has_citation": 1}, {"answer": "<think> Okay, let's see. The user is asking which disease was treated in the MR CLEAN study. Looking at the evidence provided, there are several documents. The first one mentions MR CLEAN as a study on endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The second document says it compared endovascular treatment with medical therapy for AIS. The third concludes that intraarterial treatment was effective for acute ischemic stroke with proximal occlusion. The fourth talks about IV rtPA and referring to trials like MR CLEAN. The fifth is about CADASIL, which seems unrelated. So the key here is that MR CLEAN is about acute ischemic stroke. The answer should be acute ischemic stroke, citing the relevant documents. The confidence is high because multiple sources mention AIS. But wait, the fifth document is about CADASIL, but that's a different disease. So I need to make sure not to include that. The answer is definitely acute ischemic stroke.

Another snippet [23545855:2354585 than 5_2] mentions that imetelstat targets the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. So here, they're talking about the RNA component.

So that's a direct mention of telomerase reverse transcriptase as the target. But wait, telomerase is an enzyme, right? Or is it the RNA component? Then document [23545855:23545855_2] mentions that the enzyme is expressed in 90% of tumors but not in normal cells. It also states that imetelstat is a telomerase inhibitor targeting the template region of the hTR subunit.

Looking at [26332545:26332545_1], it says Imetelstat targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. That seems directly relevant. The term \"telomerase reverse transcriptase\" refers to the enzyme telomerase, which is a reverse transcriptase that uses an RNA template to extend telomeres. So this chunk mentions the RNA template of telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is part of the telomerase enzyme complex. Next, [23545855:2354585のでしょう_2] also talks about imetelstat targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.

Craniosynostosis is a condition where bones in the skull fuse too early. The evidence includes several studies. Looking through the evidence: Document 23987506 talks about scaffold proteins and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to PKC activation. Not directly about craniosynostosis, but maybe related to signaling pathways. Document 24265417 mentions ERK1/2-mediated Cortactin-S405 phosphorylation and Rac1/Cdc42 activation.

This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. Cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria."}

Clinical gait analysis (CGA) has been highlighted as a possible tool to support the differential diagnosis of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and Spastic Diplegia (SD). Argininaimia should be considered more frequently in the differential diagnosis of a patient with slowly progressive neurologic manifestations, especially progressive spastic diplegia.

To study the contribution of transcription factors to the establishment of this specific chromatin configuration we assembled nucleosomes on the hsp26 promoter using a cell-free reconstitution system derived from fly embryos. This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites (Q.

Cultures grown with elevated CO(2) /bicarbonate exhibited increased AtxA dimer/monomer ratios and increased AtxA activity, relative to cultures grown without added CO(2) /bicarbonate, suggesting that this host-associated signal enhances AtxA function by shifting the dimer/monomer equilibrium towards the dimeric state. CO2-enhanced toxin gene transcription is not observed in atx4-null mutants. Overall data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins. Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA. The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures. All mutants multimerized, but one mutation, C402S, prevented cross-linking."}

These data show that mutations in EZH2 cause Weaver syndrome. The EZH2 gene is a homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) gene enhancer of zest, a crucial regulator of homeotic gene expression. Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, a catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are observed in ~\\n10% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but are rare in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. Mutations at tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) in the SET domain of EZH2 have been identified in patients with certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The EZH2 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of 7q35-q36 aberrations in myeloid leukaemia."}

For this purpose, gene fusion events may be used as the sole evidence or as independent information combined with other 'genome-aware' or similarity-based methods, and functional association may be predicted at different levels.

GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, many functions of these factors are recovered that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and testable hypotheses are generated. The utility of GREAT is not limited to ChIP-seq, as it could also be applied to open chromatin, localized epigenomic markers and similar functional data sets, as well as comparative genomics sets."}

This is because during transcription, RNA polymerase can stall if there's a lesion on the DNA, leading to damage on the transcribed strand. The repair process then targets this strand to correct the damage. Looking at the evidence: Chunk 17015469_1 says that TCR is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes.

The user is asking for the branch site consensus sequence in U12-dependent introns. The evidence provided is from three chunks, all pointing to the same sequence: UUCCUUAAC. First, I need to confirm that all the evidence supports the same answer. Looking at the chunks, each of them mentions that Intron F has a fully consensus branch site sequence (UUCCUUAAC). So, the answer should be that sequence. The question is about the consensus sequence, so the answer is straightforward.
