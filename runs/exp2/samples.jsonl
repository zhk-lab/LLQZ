The key points from the context: telephone counseling had a higher proportion of women getting mammograms on schedule compared to tailored print, especially after the first year. Also, for those who were off-schedule previously, telephone counseling was more effective in bringing them back on track.\n\nSo the answer should be based on these results. The study shows that tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials in promoting mammography use. Since the question is about whether tailored interventions (which include both methods) can increase use, but the study specifically compares two tailored methods. However, the conclusion is that telephone counseling was better than print. Therefore, the answer would be yes because the study found that tailored interventions (specifically telephone counseling) did lead to higher mammography use compared to usual care and even better than print"}
