New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice.

The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin.

It talks about a study with 71 patients with hypothyroidism. The study compared usual levothyroxine vs. combination with liothyronine. The results mention that psychosocial scores, including anxiety/insomnia, were similar between groups. However, there was a small significant reduction in anxiety/insomnia in the combined treatment group. Wait, so the combined treatment had less insomnia, but does that mean levothyroxine alone could cause it? The study didn't find any change in psychosocial scores for the monotherapy group. So maybe the combination therapy reduced it, but the monotherapy group didn't show an increase. But the question is about whether levothyroxine causes insomnia.

Humans lack a functional cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) protein and cannot synthesize the sugar Neu5Gc, an innate mammalian signal of self. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) can be incorporated in human cells and can trigger immune response, a response that is diverse and polyclonal. As dietary Neu5Gc is primarily found in red meat and milk products, it is suggested that this ongoing antigen-antibody reaction may generate chronic inflammation, possibly contributing to the high frequency of diet-related carcinomas and other diseases in humans."}

Cultures grown with elevated CO(2) /bicarbonate exhibited increased AtxA dimer/monomer ratios and increased AtxA activity, relative to cultures grown without added CO(2) /bicarbonate, suggesting that this host-associated signal enhances AtxA function by shifting the dimer/monomer equilibrium towards the dimeric state. CO2-enhanced toxin gene transcription is not observed in atx4-null mutants. Overall data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins. Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA. The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures. All mutants multimerized, but one mutation, C402S, prevented cross-linking."}

Whereas previous methods took into account only binding proximal to genes, GREAT is able to properly incorporate distal binding sites and control for false positives using a binomial test over the input genomic regions. GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, many functions of these factors are recovered that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and testable hypotheses are generated. The utility of GREAT is not limited to ChIP-seq, as it could also be applied to open chromatin, localized epigenomic markers and similar functional data sets, as well as comparative genomics sets."}

So here, TCR is targeting the transcribed strand.\n\nChunk 17015469_0 is a duplicate of the first one, so same info. Then chunk 20978633_0 mentions that TCR targets DNA damage on the transcribed or coding strand. Wait, but the question is about which gene strand is targeted. The term \"transcribed strand\" refers to the strand that's being transcribed into RNA, which is the template strand. But in DNA, the coding strand is the one that's complementary to the mRNA, so maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the gene strand. In genetics, the gene is usually on the DNA, and the transcription occurs from the DNA strand. The transcribed strand is the one that's used as a template for RNA,", "citations": [], "gold_docs": ["10637337", "11182543", "11452033", "11821423", "12142466", "12509290", "14599741", "14599769", "14734564", "15186415", "15249207", "15380101", "15913669", "16158195", "16394029", "16978026", "17015469", "17893751", "18291710", "18817898", "19381941", "20463888", "20978633", "21214942", "21466822", "22749141", "22902626", "7957102", "8807287", "8972850", "9065408", "9150262", "9288788", "9637246", "9934845"], "ideal_answer": "Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) removes a variety of helix-distorting lesions from DNA.

The user is asking for abnormalities in specific chromosomes associated with the disease.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the evidence provided. There are three chunks here. The first one, [10754001:10754001_1], says that familial Moyamoya disease is linked to chromosome 17q25. That's a direct mention of chromosome 17. \n\nThe second chunk, [10754001:10754001_2], mentions neurofibromatosis type 1, which is associated with the NF1 gene on chromosome 17q11.2. However, the question is about Moyamoya disease itself, not neurofibromatosis. But it's noted that the characteristic lesions can be seen in neurofibromatosis type 1. So maybe there's an association here, but the evidence doesn't directly link Moyamoya to chromosome 17q11.2.
