While these findings are consistent, the mechanism/s underlying this association remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the many ways in which differing characteristics of the gut microbiota can be tumourigenic or protective against CRC. CRC is characterised by significant dysbiosis including reduced short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. Recent findings suggest that exercise can modify the gut microbiota, and these changes are inverse to the changes seen with CRC; however, this exercise-microbiota interaction is currently understudied in CRC. This review summarises parallel areas of research that are rapidly developing: The exercise-gut microbiota research and cancer-gut microbiota research and highlights the salient similarities.

Let me go through each document one by one.\n\nStarting with [11321513:11321513_0]. This says that strenuous exercise increases the release of gut hormones like gastrin, CCK, and PP, as well as stress hormones, immediately after exercise, regardless of feeding or blood donation. That's a direct mention of physical activity (exercise) influencing gut hormones. So that's one point.\n\nNext, [21554896:21554896_0] talks about control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets being part of energy balance regulation. This seems to suggest a bidirectional relationship, but the question is about whether physical activity influences gut hormones. The wording here is a bit tricky. It says \"control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones,\" which might mean that gut hormones control activity, not the other way around. But maybe there's an implication that activity could be influenced by hormones.
