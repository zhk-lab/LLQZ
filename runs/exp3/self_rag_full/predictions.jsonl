Wait, the evidence only explicitly mentions Class I. But the third document says \"four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV)\", so maybe the answer is that they are divided into four classes (I to IV), with Class I being sodium channel blockers.

This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. Cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria."}

Aire and Deaf1 help regulate the ectopic expression of diverse tissue-specific antigens to establish self-immune tolerance. Knockdown of Aire in mouse ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. Aire promotes the expression of the pluripotent factor Lin28 and the self-renewal of ES cells. Autoimmune regulator (Aire) is one of the most well-characterized molecules in autoimmunity, but its function outside the immune system is largely unknown. The recent discovery of Aire expression in stem cells and early embryonic cells and its function in the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells highlight the importance of Aire in these cells. The recent discovery of Aire expression in stem cells and early embryonic cells and its function in the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells highlight the importance of Aire in these cells. The correlation between Aire and Lin28 expression in germ cells and early embryos indicated an in vivo function for Aire in toti- and pluripotent stem cells. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that microRNAs contribute to the regulatory function of Aire and highlights a novel function of Aire in stem cell biology and reproduction. Monitoring Aire expression in MSCs may thus be a critical parameter for clinical use."}

Then, reference 17851586 mentions rooke-Spiegler syndrome, familial cylindromatosis, and familial trichoepithelioma as autosomal-dominant conditions caused by CYLD mutations. These are all benign tumors of the skin appendages. So those three conditions are definitely linked. The third reference, 19076795, just states that CYLD mutations are responsible for familial cylindromatosis, which is already mentioned in the second reference. So that's redundant but confirms it again.

For the specific vertebrate phylum, it also provides access to ancestral gene order reconstructions and conserved non-coding elements information. The graphical modules of Genomicus show how it is capable of revealing differential gene loss and gain, segmental or genome duplications and facilitate the study of the evolution of a locus through homology relationships. The Genomicus server provides access to ancestral gene orders, as well as computationally predicted regulatory interactions, thanks to the representation of conserved non-coding elements with their putative gene targets."}

Wait, the question is general \"arthritis,\" but the evidence here is about RA. However, the answer needs to be based on the given evidence. The second chunk [17341507:17341507_0] talks about ACPA and a SNP in PTPN22 associated with RA. But that's about PTPN22, not CD84.

N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) can be incorporated in human cells and can trigger immune response, a response that is diverse and polyclonal.

Overall data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.

The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2.

The key term here is \"template for the de novo synthesis of small RNAs, termed pRNAs.\" So 6S RNA's function is related to making these pRNAs. The other document, 21463569:21463569_0, talks about little known about NAPs, but that doesn't directly relate to 6SRNA. So the main evidence is from the first two documents. Wait, the question is specifically about 6SRNA. The documents refer to \"6S RNAs\" and mention pRNAs. But in the answer, should it be 6S RNA or 6SRNA?

The third chunk (21463569) talks about little being known about NAPs in bacteria, but that's probably not relevant here since it doesn't mention 6SRNA specifically.

The confidence level: since all three chunks in the same document agree on the sequence, the model can be confident. The citations are from the same source, so there's no conflicting information.

Let me start by looking at the evidence provided. The user provided three chunks from the same document with ID 18824513. All three chunks mention that Intron F contains a fully consensus branch site sequence (UUCCUUAAC). The first chunk also talks about the importance of these sequences for splicing, but the specific answer is in the other two chunks. The question is asking for the consensus sequence, so the answer should be UUCCUUAAC. The citations are all from the same document, so I need to reference the correct chunk IDs. Each of the three chunks has the same content, so maybe they are different parts of the same section. The answer should include the sequence and cite one of the chunks.

The user is asking about the branch site consensus sequence in U12-dependent introns. The evidence provided has three chunks from the same document, all citing the same study (18824513). Looking at the evidence, each chunk mentions that Intron F has a fully consensus branch site sequence of \"UUCCUUAAC\". The question is about the consensus sequence, so the answer should be this sequence. The confidence here is pretty high because all three chunks independently state the same thing. The study's focus is on mutations in the branch site, implying that the sequence they report is indeed the consensus. I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. Since all three evidence points agree, the answer is straightforward. The base confidence can be set to 1.0 since the information is consistent across multiple chunks of the same source. </think> { \"answer\": \"The branch site consensus sequence in U12-dependent introns is UUCCUUAAC [18824513:18824513_0][1882451", "base_prob": 0.5, "critic": {"rel_label": "Irrel", "rel_prob": 0.5, "sup_label": "Partial", "sup_prob": 0.5, "use_score": 3, "use_prob": 0.6, "notes": ""}, "score": 2.6}], "selected_score": 2.6, "gold_docs": ["18824513"], "ideal_answer": "The branch site consensus sequence in U12-dependent introns is UUCCUUAAC."}
